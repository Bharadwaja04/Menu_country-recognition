# Menu_country-recognition

This is my first NLP project where I took the data of 50 random restaurants from a place. By the menu I predicted the country that menu belongs to. I used pipeline,Logistic Regression, CountVectorizer to solve this problem.
-> I preprocessed the text
-> Logistic Regressor is used to fit and predict
-> Count vectorizer is used to convert words into vectors
-> Pipeline is something where the Logistic regression and Count Vectorizer were implemented
